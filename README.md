# Drag Anything To Hotbar for Foundry VTT

Allows drag & drop of Actors, Items, Roll Tables, Journals, Sounds and Playlists into the Macro Hotbar with the following effects:

* **Actors** - Open Sheet (Needs create new Tokens permission)
* **Journal Entries** - Open Journal
* **Roll Tables** - Draws from Table
* **Sounds** - Play a sound (Will only work from Foundry V9 and onwards)
* **Playlists** - Play/Stop toggle
* **Items** - Open Item (At world level)

### Notes
_For Non-GMs:_ Players need permission to see the entity in order to be able to drag and drop into the Hotbar. Except for **Actors** which also need the **permission to create new Tokens**. It is required in order to drag & drop actors. 

_For individual sounds:_ This Feature only works on the upcoming Foundry V9 since it is a new feature in Foundry to be able to drag and drop sounds.
