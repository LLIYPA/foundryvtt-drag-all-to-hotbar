# JV's Drag Anything To Hotbar for Foundry VTT
### _Created by: JeansenVaars_ - [Invite me a coffee if you like this module :D](https://ko-fi.com/jeansenvaars)
[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/V7V14D3AH)

Allows drag & drop of Actors, Items, Roll Tables, Journals, Sounds and Playlists into the Macro Hotbar with the following effects:

* **Actors** - Open Sheet
* **Journal Entries** - Open Journal - or PDF if PDFoundry
* **Roll Tables** - Draws from Table
* **Sounds** - Play a sound (Will only work from Foundry V9 and onwards)
* **Playlists** - Play/Stop toggle
* **Items** - Open Item (At world level)
* **Compendiums** - Open the Compendium Folder
* **Compendium Content** - Same for all of the above except Sounds

This module is very simple and does not do anything new or fancy. It is all made of Foundry existing capabilities.

### Notes
_For individual sounds:_ This Feature only works on the upcoming Foundry V9 since it is a new feature in Foundry to be able to drag and drop sounds.
